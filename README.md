Everyone likes when computer does all the job right?
Well I am one of them too (smile icon).
As a beginner, I've written these bash scripts to automate my boring stuff.(crying smile)

Here is what they are for:

complete.sh - if you download movie (on legit way) ,many times you'll  need subtitles for it.
Now those subtitles come in zip...You need to move all .srt files and .mp4 file in same dir,rename all subtitles so that they match movie name in order to get the job done.
Well, what this script does is: extracts and moves all .srt files with .mp4 file in the new dir with name of the .mp4 file(obviously...) and renames all .srt files to name of .mp4 file in order to work.

T.L.D.R.(too long didn't read)
Just download your movie (.mp4 extension) and all subtitles for it,make sure they are all in the same directory, and run the script.
Voila, your movie is in separate dir with all subtitles renamed in one go.
For more info see the script
